### tmux.conf
Since discovering the terminal multiplexer tmux, I've found it to be indispensable. I rarely have a use for a GUI anymore and will even open a new pane with the text-based browser Lynx for web use.

In this configuration file, I've made some alterations like changing the command prefix from CTRL (Control Button)-B to CTRL-A (a very popular change), enabling UTF8 exclusively, enabling 256-color mode, setting pane splitting keys to H (for horizontal) and V (for vertical), enabling mouse support to move and resize panes, enabling the ALT-(Arrow) key use to switch panes (another popular change), and making some dramatic changes to the status bar at the bottom of the screen (changing it's color from that annoying bright green to a very, very dark blue color that's easier on the eyes and creating a new design for it). These are only some of the changes made; please see the file itself to see them all.
